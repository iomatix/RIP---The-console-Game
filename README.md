# RIP - The console Game
My old console game, compiled for Windows OS.

### Important note: 
The game is made mostly with batch files and an overlay made with C#. The game shouldn't hurt the device but keep in mind you are using it on your own risk. **It is not a malware** but it bugs audio sometimes.
[To repair the bug launch this file](https://github.com/iomatix/RIP---The-console-Game/blob/master/Release/RIP/audio_close.bat)

The game is not intended to offend anyone. The R.I.P is an expression of my own artistic feelings.

### Warning: This software is not suitable for children or peaople with anxiety. Be sure you are at least sixteen years old and can handle that experience.
